    "$R_s$ is used to protect the battery from high current or to limit the output in case of shortcircuit.\n",

    "> When an overload occurs the device shuts down Darlington NPN output stage or reduces the output current to prevent device damage.\n",
    "> The device will automatically reset from the overload.\n",
    "> The output may be reduced or alternate between on and off until the overload is removed.\n",
